# Checkbook
Checkbook is a self-contained API server. Back in the early 1980's, I developed a Checkwriter device using a two line alpha numeric LCD display, a small QWERTY keyboard and an embedded ink jet printer with sealed check cartridge to print the check and eject. There was no internet nor any smart phones or IOT devices. This project is a reconcilation of that project using current technology.

# EOL or End-of-Life
When a piece of software is useful, there should never be an EOL doctrine. The intention for this application is to achieve immoratlity ;).

At some point of time in the future, this project may appear to be dead and abandon. The opposite will be true!

When this project reaches that stage, this project has matured to a level where maintenance is minimal (mostly updating to latest version of Node).
